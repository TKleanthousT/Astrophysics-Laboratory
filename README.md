## Philosophy
- You learn better by doing than by listening.  
- Repetition aids learning — each topic appears 3–4 times in different ways.  
- You do not fully understand something until you can teach it to others.  
- Science is collaborative.  
- Real scientific research is possible at a young age.

## Core Material
The course emphasizes **statistics** and **computer programming** as essential astrophysics tools:

- Python fundamentals (logic, loops, plotting, etc.)  
- Analyzing large datasets  
- Probability & statistics theory (confidence, uncertainty, inference)  
- Bayesian vs. classical inference  
- Data fitting, including **MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo)**  
- Random distributions  

### Applications to Astrophysics
- Populations of binary stars  
- Stellar activity: spots, flares, rotation rates  
- Photometry with TESS  
- Stellar spectral types & magnitudes  
- Light curve analysis: detrending, periodograms, autocorrelation functions  

### Skills Developed
- Collaboration & teamwork  
- Teaching others (coding tutorials, outreach videos, presentations)  
- Academic conference-style talks

## Equipment
- Laptop required (any OS; doesn’t need to be high-end — cluster/cloud provided).
